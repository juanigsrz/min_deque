# op_deque
An enhanced deque data structure, implemented on C++.
This deque is capable of answering, in amortized O(F) time,
the result of applying some function F to all the elements in the deque.

## Use
First, include the op_deque with `#include "op_deque.cpp"`

To instantiate a new op_deque, use `op_deque<T, F> Name;`

- `T` is the type of the elements in the deque
- `F` is a commutative and associative functor with arity 2
- `Name` is the name of your instance.

## Basic methods
Method name     | Description
--------------- | --------------
`size()`        | get the number of elements
`[i]`           | get the element at the i-th index
`pop_front()`   | pop the element at the front
`pop_back()`    | pop the element at the back
`push_front(x)` | push a new element x at the front
`push_back(x)`  | push a new element x at the back
`front()`       | get the element at the front
`back()`        | get the element at the back

## Special methods
Method name   | Description
------------- | -------------
`get()`       | get, in O(F) amortized time, the result of applying F to the whole deque

### To do:
- Study and modify the order of operations to relax the commutative functor requirement
- Replace `rastack<T>` with `vector<T>`
- Improve the asymptotic constant by optimizing `balance()`
- Formal proof
